## Project Description: 
This project will take Philadelphia crime data and data from four major leage sport Teams (Phillies, 76'ers, Flyers and Eagles) to determine if there is an increased, decreased or neutral effect on the violent property crime rates in the neighborhoods surrounding the teams' respective venues on game days.

Graphical User Interface will be built using Swing.
